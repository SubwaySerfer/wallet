        <h3>Secure by Default</h3>
        <p>
          Security is not a component but something that is fundamental in our
          services. We ensure that security is taken into consideration in every
          step of every process within our company. We strive to be best in
          class.

        <h3>Monitoring and Alerting</h3>
        <p>
          We monitor all our validators real time with our inhouse developed
          metrics dashboard that we made available for the Solana Community to
          use. We measure all relevant validator performance metrics like
          skiprate, server load, cpu, ram and disk usage. We alert our 24x7
          support team when validator metrics are out of the normal.
